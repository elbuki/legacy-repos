Task ManagerÂ² Dev notes

There has been a delay in the commits due to a git problem in my computer so the first commit is pushed in August 3rd.

Here's the things I've done so far:

	* Home page for mobile and desktop.
	* Application object with all functions and properties.
	* Login form with modal.
	* Main screen with side navigator for mobile devices.
