# Legacy repositories

This is the code I used to write, I downloaded all the repos and merged into just one repository. I don't know, it feels more clean, but the bad side about doing this is that all my commits are gone. Well, everything in life has a price to pay, right?

## Please notice that the code used here is not going to be maintained.
